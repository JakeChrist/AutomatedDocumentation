# HTML Documentation Usability Review

This review captures the main opportunities that were addressed to improve readability and user experience in the generated HTML documentation, along with additional recommendations for future refinement.

## Improvements implemented

- **Responsive typography and color palette.** The documentation now uses a balanced system font stack, improved line spacing, and softer colors that increase contrast without overwhelming the reader. Code elements adopt a dedicated monospace font and consistent background to aid scanning.
- **Accessible layout controls.** The sidebar toggle button exposes `aria` attributes, and the layout remembers the collapsed state. A "Skip to main content" link helps keyboard and screen-reader users bypass navigation links quickly.
- **Enhanced navigation clarity.** Active navigation entries are highlighted and marked with `aria-current` so readers can immediately see their location within the documentation tree. Headings gain consistent spacing to delineate sections.
- **Content focus.** Main content and footer regions honor a maximum width, preventing long line lengths that slow reading. Tables, block quotes, and inline code receive updated styling for better legibility.

## Additional recommendations

- **Search integration.** Adding a lightweight client-side search (for example, using Lunr.js) would help users locate relevant modules or symbols quickly across large projects.
- **Bread crumb trails.** For deeply nested modules, breadcrumbs mirroring the directory hierarchy could reinforce context alongside the highlighted navigation link.
- **Theme support.** Introducing a dark-theme toggle would accommodate different lighting preferences and improve accessibility for users sensitive to bright backgrounds.
- **Print styles.** A dedicated print stylesheet could optimize spacing and suppress interactive controls when users need PDF exports or physical copies.

These enhancements create a cleaner reading experience today while outlining next steps that can continue to improve discoverability and accessibility for DocGen-LM documentation consumers.
